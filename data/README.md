# Production

The file words.json.gz was created by loading the Wordnet synsets via Python [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/).

A JSON file was produced in the following format:

```json
{
    "<POS>": ["array", "of", "words"]
}
```

Where `<POS>` is a part of speech signifier in singular form such as "noun" and "adjective".

# Contents

The current words.json.gz contains the following word counts:

| POS | Count |
| --- | ----- |
| noun/noun phrase | 82,115 |
| adjective | 18,156 |

Generated environment names are of the form `<adjective>-<noun/noun phrase>`.

This allows 1,490,879,940 possible unique environment names.

# Replacement

If you want to replace the bundled word set with your own, replace words.json.gz with your own gzip-compressed JSON file with "noun" and "adjective" word arrays. Ensure that you have enough words to allow
sufficient unique names for your installation, or environment creation will fail. Note that any glyphs that are not DNS-legal (do not match `[A-Za-z0-9\-_]`) will be filtered out.
